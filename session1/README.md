Definitions:



Convolution - Image transformation process where information contained in an image is extracted using a kernel/filter which scans over the image. The values of the kernel is multipled with the pixels on the convolving region and then summed up.  


Filters/Kernels - Matrix that are used to perform the transformation during the convultion process. generally a 3 x 3 kernel is used to extract features.


Epochs - Training on all the elements in the dataset once is 1 epoc.


1x1 Convolution - 1 x 1 filter is used to recude the dimensions. It is generally used to combine features.


3x3 Convolution - 3 x 3 filter is used to extract features.


Feature Maps - The output of a trained kernel is going to be a feature map - collection of all features


Activation Function -


Receptive Field - Local Receptive Field of a pixel is the area it convolves over
